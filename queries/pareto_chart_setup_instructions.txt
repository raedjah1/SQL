Power BI Pareto Chart Setup - Secondary Y-Axis for Percentage Line

1. CREATE THE COMBO CHART:
   - Visual type: Combo Chart (Clustered Column & Line Chart)
   - X-axis: TestCategory (sorted by OccurrenceCount descending)

2. ADD COLUMN VALUES (Bars - Left Y-Axis):
   - Y-axis: OccurrenceCount
   - This will show as bars on the left side

3. ADD LINE VALUES (Line - Right Y-Axis):
   - Y-axis: Cumulative Percentage (your measure)
   - Click on the measure in the "Line values" well
   - In the formatting pane, find "Y-Axis" section
   - Toggle ON "Secondary" or "Use secondary axis"
   - This moves the line to the right Y-axis

4. FORMAT THE SECONDARY Y-AXIS (Right Side - Percentages):
   - Select the visual
   - Go to Format visual pane
   - Expand "Y-Axis (Line)" or "Secondary Y-Axis"
   - Set:
     * Min: 0
     * Max: 100
     * Display units: None (or show as percentage)
     * Format: Percentage (or set decimal places to 0)
     * Title: "Cumulative %" or "Percentage"

5. FORMAT THE PRIMARY Y-AXIS (Left Side - Counts):
   - Expand "Y-Axis (Column)" or "Primary Y-Axis"
   - Set appropriate min/max for your count values
   - Title: "Occurrence Count" or "Count"

6. OPTIONAL FORMATTING:
   - Make sure TestCategory is sorted by OccurrenceCount (descending)
   - Format the line: Make it thicker, different color (often red)
   - Format bars: Choose a color that contrasts with the line

RESULT:
- Left Y-axis: Shows count values (0, 50, 100, etc.) for the bars
- Right Y-axis: Shows percentage values (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) for the line
- The line will go from 0% to 100% on the right side
- The bars show actual counts on the left side
